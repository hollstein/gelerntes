Today I used the great library [python-docx](https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/install.html) to create a rather complex report in MS Word. Why Word? It was the quickest way to get my results into the hands of colleagues from the business. I was using a not so large LLM locally on my gpu server to generate a report for decision making around some or our relevant topics. In the mix went the awesome [transfomrers](https://pypi.org/project/transformers/) library as well as [BERTopic](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html) for clustering.

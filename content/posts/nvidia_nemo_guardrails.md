Using LLMs safely keeps me up at night, especially when working for a pharma company where our decisions can impact patients. This area still needs tremendous amounts of research, but seeing things like [NeMo Guardrails](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Guardrails) looks promising. The guardrails are *programmed* in the language of LLMs, plain English, which in principle allows evolving these guardrails fast. How to manage these guardrails to not become an entangled mess is left to be seen.

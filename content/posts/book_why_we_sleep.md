"Why We Sleep" by Matthew Walker Ph.D. is a great read to bring you up to speed about what we scientifically know about sleep today. He describes the results and implications of many years of research and doesn't shy away on describing how the research experiments were done and designed. Fascinating read. 

Quick messages to take away:

- A good amount of healthy sleep is so important for overall health and lifespan that it is rational to prioritize getting it.
- Negatively impacting healthy sleep is:
  - Drinking alcohol late, if not drinking alcohol is not an option, this is a healthy argument for moderate day drinking.
  - Same goes for caffeine, don't consume coffey late. Even if you think is is not impacting your sleep (amount), the sleep itself is not functioning as good as it should be.
- Sleep research experiments and research is fascinating.

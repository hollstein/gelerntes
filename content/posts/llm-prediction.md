I haven't seen a field (NLP) change this rapid in such a short period of time during my professional career. This is fascinating times indeed. These are my current predictions and mental models: 

- LLMs hare here to stay: They are useful, useful things will find their nice and stick around. Their prevalence and if one notices them as such is much harder to predict.   
- It will take some time until Simon Willisons mental model of [calculator for words](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/2/calculator-for-words/) will become common sense. When this happens, the hype will turn into a more pragmatic search for useful applications. (This is more of a hope than a prediction.) 
- LLMs will become
  - Commodity: Meaning there is little competitive advantage gained from private closed source models. If private models emerge which provide such benefits, open-source models will emerge with the same or higher level of usefulness and replace the closed ones.
  - Mature: there is a Cambrian explosion going on in the field right now, at some point the emerging ecology of models will have colonized the space and the rate of change will slow down. There will be a sweet spot of computation cost (which related to real costs) and usefulness where persistent models find their nice. 
- Time of maturity: Stabilization and stagnation of the filed will occur by the end of 2024


That being said, the likelihood of each of them being true is small, but this is just the nature of predictions about the real world.
